As a Business Analyst on the EJADHA project, my primary responsibility was to ensure continuous monitoring and support of the application, which is used by firemen and workers in Dubai for safety purposes. The application enables users to quickly raise an alert if they identify any potential dangers in their working environment.

Although the application was already developed, my role focused on maintaining the team's availability to address any issues that might arise during live operations. I closely monitored the app's performance and ensured that any problems were promptly identified and escalated for resolution, thereby maintaining the integrity and reliability of the safety system.
