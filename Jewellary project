As a Business Analyst on the Jewelry Management project, I faced significant challenges due to the need to work within the client's server environment, 
which was plagued by network issues. These challenges made it tedious and time-consuming to manage tasks effectively. Despite these difficulties, 
I was responsible for navigating and mitigating these obstacles to ensure the successful completion of the project. 
My role involved coordinating with the team, troubleshooting issues as they arose, and ensuring that project timelines were adhered to, 
even in a less-than-ideal working environment.
