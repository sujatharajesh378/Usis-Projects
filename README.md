"As a Business Analyst, my role involved communicating with clients 💬 and providing feedback to developers using JIRA 💻. 
Some projects required working on the client’s server, which posed challenges ⏳ due to time-consuming processes and occasional delays in meeting deadlines. 
However, despite these difficulties, we successfully completed the project on time ⏰.
I was also responsible for documenting the entire process 📝."
